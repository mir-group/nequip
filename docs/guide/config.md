# Config File

The config file has five main sections: `run`, `data`, `trainer`, `training_module`, `global_options`. These top level config entries must always be present.

Before going into what each section entails, users are advised to take note of OmegaConf's [variable interpolation](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#variable-interpolation) utilities, which may be a useful tool for managing runs.
Interpolation can be particularly useful when multiple locations in the config require the same values to be repeated.
It can also be used to access information like the run name or output directory of the training using [Hydra's built-in resolvers](https://hydra.cc/docs/1.3/configure_hydra/intro/#resolvers-provided-by-hydra).

NequIP also registers a number of custom resolvers to allow users to do basic integer arithmetic directly in the config file:
- Integer multiplication: `area: ${int_mul:${width},${height}}`
- Integer division: `half_width: ${int_div:${width},2}`
These resolvers will throw errors if the inputs are not integers or if division is not exact.


## `run`

`run` allows users to specify an ordered agenda of tasks to run, of which there are three types: `train` (which requires a `train` and at least one `val` dataset), `val` (which requires `val` dataset(s)), and `test` (which requires `test` dataset(s)).

Users can specify one or more of these run types in the config. A common use mode is to perform training, followed immediately by testing:
```yaml
run: [train, test]
```

```{important}
Any `val` or `test` tasks that come after `train` will use the best model checkpoint.
```

If you want to check how the untrained model performs on the validation and test datasets at initialization before training, train, and then assess the trained model's performance:
```yaml
run: [val, test, train, val, test]
```

```{note}
[Continuing training from a checkpoint file](./workflow.md#restarts) will continue from the last `run` task the checkpoint file was at before stopping. For example, if one uses `run: [test, train, val, test]` and a `nequip-train` run crashed at the `train` step, a run restarted from that checkpoint will continue in the `train` stage (skipping the initial `test` stage that had already been completed in the previously crashed run).
```


## `data`

`data` is the `DataModule` object to be used. Users are directed to the [API page](../api/datamodule.rst) of `nequip.data.datamodule` for the `nequip` supported `DataModule` classes. Custom datamodules that subclass from `nequip.data.datamodule.NequIPDataModule` can also be used.


## `trainer`

The `trainer` is meant to instantiate a `lightning.Trainer` object. To understand how to configure it, users are directed to `lightning.Trainer`'s [page](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html). The sections on trainer [flags](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html#trainer-flags) and its [API](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html#trainer-class-api) are especially important.

```{tip}
It is in the `lightning.Trainer` that users can specify [callbacks](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api_references.html#callbacks) used to influence the course of training. This includes the very important [ModelCheckpoint](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint.html#lightning.pytorch.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint) callback that should be configured to save checkpoint files in the way the user so pleases. `nequip`'s own [callbacks](../api/callbacks.rst) can also be used here.
```

### Logging

`nequip` supports various loggers through PyTorch Lightning, including its [built-in loggers](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api_references.html#loggers), e.g. Tensorboard, Weights & Biases, etc.

#### Tensorboard

Tensorboard can be configured, for example, as follows:
```yaml
logger:
  _target_: lightning.pytorch.loggers.TensorBoardLogger
  # The run name in tensorboard can be, for example, inherited from Hydra.
  version: ${hydra:job.name}
  # By default (not if overridden) Hydra will make `./outputs` and put various runs at `./outputs/{name}`.
  # Here we add an additional `./outputs/tensorboard_logs` within which logs will be stored _across_ runs.
  save_dir: outputs/tensorboard_logs
```
The full set of options are found in the documentation of the [underlying object from PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.loggers.tensorboard.html#module-lightning.pytorch.loggers.tensorboard).

## `training_module`

`training_module` defines the `NequIPLightningModule` (or its subclasses). Users are directed to its [API page](../api/lightning_module.rst) to learn how to configure it. Often, the `EMALightningModule` is a reliable choice.

It is here that the following parameters are defined.
 
 ### `model`
  It is under `model` that the deep equivariant potential model is configured, which includes the NequIP message-passing graph neural network model or the strictly local Allegro model. Refer to the [model documentation page](../api/model) to learn how to configure this section.

 ### `loss` and `metrics`
  Loss functions and metrics to monitor training progress are configured here in the `training_module`. Refer to the [Loss and Metrics](stats_metrics.md/#loss-and-metrics) docs for more information.

 ### `optimizer` and `lr_scheduler`

  The `optimizer` can be any PyTorch-compatible optimizer. Options from PyTorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#algorithms). The [Adam](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html#torch.optim.Adam) optimizer, for example, can be configured as follows: 
```yaml
optimizer:
  _target_: torch.optim.Adam
  lr: 0.01
```
  The `lr_scheduler` is configured according to PyTorch Lightning's `lr_scheduler_config` (see [here](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.core.LightningModule.html#lightning.pytorch.core.LightningModule.configure_optimizers) for the full range of options). Consider the following use of `ReduceLROnPlateau` as an example.
```yaml
lr_scheduler:
  scheduler:
    _target_: torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau
    factor: 0.6
    patience: 5
    threshold: 0.2
    min_lr: 1e-6
  monitor: val0_epoch/weighted_sum
  interval: epoch
  frequency: 1
```
  The `scheduler` is a PyTorch-compatible learning rate scheduler. Options from PyTorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate).

## `global_options`

`global_options` is used to specify parameters that affect the global state. Presently, the only option is `allow_tf32` (which is `false` by default). See the [TF32 page](./tf32.md) for more details about TF32 settings.
```yaml
global_options:
  allow_tf32: false
```
