> [!IMPORTANT]
> A [major backwards-incompatible update](./docs/guide/upgrading.md) to the `nequip` package was released on April 23rd 2025 as version v0.7.0. The previous version v0.6.2 can still be found for use with existing config files in the GitHub Releases and on PyPI.

## Installation and usage

Installation instructions and user guides can be found in our [docs](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Tutorial 

The best way to learn how to use NequIP is through the [tutorial notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mir-group/nequip-tutorial/blob/main/NequIP_Tutorial.ipynb). This will run entirely on Google Colab's cloud virtual machine; you do not need to install or run anything locally.

## Community, contact, questions, and contributing

If you find a bug or have a proposal for a feature, please post it in the [Issues](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip/issues).
If you have a self-contained question or other discussion topic, try our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip/discussions).

Active users and interested developers are invited to join us on the NequIP community chat server, which is hosted on the excellent [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) software.
Zulip is organized a little bit differently than chat software like Slack or Discord that you may be familiar with: please review [their introduction](https://zulip.com/help/introduction-to-topics) before posting.
[Fill out the interest form for the NequIP community here](https://forms.gle/mEuonVCHdsgTtLXy7).

If you want to contribute to the code, please read ["Contributing to NequIP"](docs/dev/contributing.md).
