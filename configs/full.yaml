# `model_builders` defines a series of functions that will be called to construct the model
# each model builder has the opportunity to update the model, the config, or both
# model builders from other packages are allowed (see mir-group/allegro for an example); those from `nequip.model` don't require a prefix
# these are the default model builders:
model_builders:
 - SimpleIrrepsConfig         # update the config with all the irreps for the network if using the simplified `l_max` / `num_features` / `parity` syntax
 - EnergyModel                # build a full NequIP model
 - PerSpeciesRescale          # add per-atom / per-species scaling and shifting to the NequIP model before the total energy sum
 - ForceOutput                # wrap the energy model in a module that uses autodifferention to compute the forces
 - RescaleEnergyEtc           # wrap the entire model in the appropriate global rescaling of the energy, forces, etc.

# key_mapping:

#   format: vasp-out

  - C

# Alternatively, you may explicitly specify which chemical species in the input will map to NequIP atom type 0, which to atom type 1, and so on.

# (this also sets the number of types)

#   - my_type
#   - atom
#   - thing

# As an alternative option to npz, you can also pass data ase ASE Atoms-objects
