# data set
# the keys used need to be stated at least once in key_mapping, npz_fixed_field_keys or npz_keys
# key_mapping is used to map the key in the npz file to the NequIP default values (see data/_key.py)
# all arrays are expected to have the shape of (nframe, natom, ?) except the fixed fields
# note that if your data set uses pbc, you need to also pass an array that maps to the nequip "pbc" key
